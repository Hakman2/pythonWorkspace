This workspace is set up for Python coding practice and study. 

## Structure

- Use Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration.
- Add dependencies to `requirements.txt`.

## Getting Started
1. Open or create Python files for your code.
2. Use the built-in terminal to run scripts: `python your_script.py`
3. Install dependencies with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Happy coding!
